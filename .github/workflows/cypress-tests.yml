###Notes          
# To block merges when tests fail, configure branch protection in GitHub:
# 1. Go to Repository Settings → Branches.
# 2. Under "Branch protection rules", click "Add rule".
# 3. Set the branch name pattern to: main
# 4. Enable the following options:
#    - "Require status checks to pass before merging"
#      → Select the workflow named: Cypress Tests
#    - (Optional) "Require branches to be up to date before merging"
