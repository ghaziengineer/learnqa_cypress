# Name of the GitHub Actions workflow that will appear in the Actions tab
name: Cypress Tests

# Trigger configuration - defines when this workflow should run
on:
  # Run on push events to the specified branches
  push:
    branches: [main] # List of branches that trigger the workflow on push
  # Also run on pull request events to the specified branches

  cypress-tests:
    # Specifies the type of virtual machine runner to use
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest # Uses the latest Ubuntu runner

    # List of steps that will be executed sequentially as part of this job
    steps:
      # Step 1: Checkout the repository code
      - name: Checkout code
        # Uses the official GitHub checkout action to get the repository code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Set up Node.js environment
      - name: Setup Node.js
        # Uses the official GitHub setup-node action
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        # Configuration parameters passed to the action
        with:
          node-version: "20" # Specifies Node.js version 20 to be installed

      # Step 3: Install project dependencies
      - name: Install dependencies
        # Shell command to install npm packages
        run: npm install

      # Step 4: Create test data file from GitHub secret
      - name: Create testData.json from secret
        # Multi-line shell script (the pipe | indicates multi-line)
        run: |

          echo "testData.json created from GitHub Secret"

      # Step 5: Create Excel fixture file from base64 encoded secret
      - name: Create template_data.xlsx from secret
        run: |
          # Check if the secret is set, exit with error if not

            echo "Error: TEMPLATE_DATA_XLSX_BASE64 secret is not set."
            exit 1  # Exit with error code 1
          fi
          # Decode the base64 secret and write to Excel file
          echo '${{ secrets.TEMPLATE_DATA_XLSX_BASE64 }}' | base64 -d > cypress/fixtures/template_data.xlsx
          echo "template_data.xlsx fixture created from GitHub Secret"

      # Step 6: Verify that test data files were created successfully
      - name: Verify test data
        run: |
          # List files in the fixtures directory with details
          ls -la cypress/fixtures/
          # Print success message
          echo "Test data files created successfully"

      # Step 7: Execute Cypress tests in headless mode
      - name: Run Cypress tests
        # Run Cypress tests using npx (npm package executor)
        run: npx cypress run

      # Step 8: Upload test artifacts only if the previous steps failed
      - name: Upload test results on failure
        # Conditional execution - only run if previous steps failed
        if: failure()
        # Use the upload-artifact action to save test results
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        # Configuration for the upload action

          name: cypress-failures # Name of the artifact
          path: | # List of paths to upload (multi-line)
            cypress/screenshots/  # Screenshots taken during test failures
            cypress/videos/       # Video recordings of test runs
          retention-days: 3 # How long to keep the artifacts (3 days)
###Notes
# To block merges when tests fail, configure branch protection in GitHub:
# 1. Go to Repository Settings → Branches.
# 2. Under "Branch protection rules", click "Add rule".
# 3. Set the branch name pattern to: main
# 4. Enable the following options:
#    - "Require status checks to pass before merging"
#      → Select the workflow named: Cypress Tests
#    - (Optional) "Require branches to be up to date before merging"
